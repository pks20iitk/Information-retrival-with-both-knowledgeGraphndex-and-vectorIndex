In this repo I implemented jupyter notebook  for information extraction with using KnowledgeGraphIndex, VectorIndex and LamaIndex

During the development of the Knowledge Graph for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline, we encountered challenges at various stages of the pipeline, as outlined below:
Generic Cypher Query generation from natural query or text:
Problem: We are facing challenges in formulating a generic Cypher query that can effectively retrieve relevant information from our knowledge graph.
Explanation: Crafting a query that is versatile enough to adapt to various data structures and relationships within the knowledge graph is crucial. The struggle lies in creating a query that strikes a balance between specificity and generality.
Building a Knowledge Graph from Contracts:
Problem: We are encountering difficulties in the process of extracting and organizing information from contracts to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph.
Explanation: The complexity of legal language and varied contract structures poses a hurdle in the extraction and representation of meaningful entities and their relationships. Determining the optimal approach to translate legal text into a structured format for the knowledge graph is a significant challenge.
Leveraging Existing Ontologies for Relationship Acceleration:
Problem: We are exploring ways to efficiently leverage existing ontologies to expedite the establishment of relationships within our knowledge graph.
Explanation: Integrating external ontologies seamlessly into our knowledge graph requires careful consideration of compatibility and alignment. The challenge lies in identifying and adopting relevant ontologies that align with our domain, as well as mapping and connecting them effectively to enhance relationship inference.

LLMs have revolutionized information extraction from unstructured text. The image illustrates the information extraction pipeline, turning text into a knowledge graph. Nodes represent entities, and connections show relationships. Knowledge graphs are handy for various tasks. Despite LLMs making extraction more accessible, challenges remain. We'll use OpenAI functions and LangChain to build a knowledge graph, discussing best practices and LLM limitations along
